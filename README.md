## Our Forest Fire Detection Project üå≤üî•
### Project Overview:
In recent years, extreme forest fires in regions like Australia, Russia, and the United States of America (USA) have raised global awareness of the devastating effects of wildfires. These fires have led to the destruction of habitats, the deaths of countless animals (many of which are rare species), a lack of oxygen, damage to the ozone layer, destruction of homes, and the disappearance of various plant species.
### Our Solution:
We aim to tackle these issues by using satellite technology to detect and prevent forest fires. Our project involves deploying **48 satellites** in orbit around the Earth, equipped with sensors to monitor forests globally. These satellites will collect data and take images of forests to detect wildfires in real-time.
### The collected data includes parameters such as:
- **Temperature**
- **Wind Speed**
- **Storm Activity**
- **Rainfall**
- **Fine Fuel Moisture**
- **Relative Humidity**
### Technology and Components Used:
Our forest fire detection system utilizes various hardware components and sensors to effectively detect and monitor fire hazards in real-time. Here are the main components:
- **Flame Sensor:** Detects the presence of fire by sensing infrared light emitted from flames, allowing early detection of fires.
- **DHT11 Sensor:** Measures temperature and humidity to help predict the risk of fire. Changes in environmental conditions can trigger early warnings.
- **SD Card Module:** Used for storing collected data from the sensors for later analysis and record-keeping, ensuring a history of environmental changes.
- **NRF24 Module:** A wireless communication module that acts as a connection between the receiver and transmitter, enabling real-time data transmission between the sensors in remote areas and the central monitoring system.
  # 
**These components allow for continuous monitoring of environmental factors that can contribute to forest fires, providing real-time data to alert authorities and prevent widespread damage.**
